# Prediction_of_company_profit

The dataset that's we see here contains data about 50 startups. It has 5 columns: “R&D Spend”, “Administration”, “Marketing Spend”, “State”, “Profit”.
The first 3 columns indicate how much each startup spends on Research and Development, how much they spend on Marketing, and how much they spend on administration cost, the state column indicates which state the startup is based in, and the last column states the profit made by the startup.

Conclusion:
The Administration Expense, Marketing Expense, R.D Spend and State were modelled with Profit. The goal was to predict the relationship of Profit with any / all of these variables. 
As per the model, the start-up’s Profit varies with two variables, ie., Marketing Expense and R.D Spend. The other two variables which are Administration Expense and State, have very little effect on the Profit. 
R.D.Spend has the maximum impact on the Company’s Profit. 
R.D Spend is a major factor influencing the Profits. There is a strong link / association between R.D Spend and Profits. 95% of variations in Profit can be explained by R.D. Spend.
To elucidate, if the Company is willing to increase the R.D Spend every 0.8 units, then Company’s Profit will increase by 1 unit.
